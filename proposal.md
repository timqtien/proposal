# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Statistical Tester

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that takes in a dataset, asks a few questions to determine what statistical tests to run, and outputs the resulting values and/or charts. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our project will take in a dataset, ask some questions about what statistical tests to run on the dataset, and output the result of those tests. The input for the datasets will be given as a parameter for the corresponding dataset excel file. Once the dataset is entered, the program will run and ask questions about what kind of tests the user would to perform (requiring a yes or no answer). Once these questions are answered, the program will run several logic functions to determine what tests to use (is the sample size large enough?; Z-test vs T-test). Once this is determined, the program will print the output of these tests and any applicable charts/visualizations. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The program WILL take in a dataset and be able to perform at least one statistical test on the dataset. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The program should be able to take in a dataset, ask questions about what statistcal tests to run on the dataset, and output the values of the selected tests. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Ideally, the program should be able to take in a dataset, ask questions about statistical test to run, output the corresponding values, and be able to chart relevant visualizations. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The new skills I will need to acquire to make this program work successfully is knowledge of the python modules pandas, statistics, and matplotlib. These modules will be essential to making this program work as pandas will be used to import the dataset, statistics will be used to perform the statistical tests, and matplotlib will display any required visualizations. This will require me to learn more about how to use the functions within these modules as well as mkaing sure my knowledge of statistics is sufficient to ensure the correct tests are being applied and the output is reasonable. Logan and I will be splitting the work evenly and trying to learn all these modules together.
